---

A lightweight and easy to use Rust logging library that includes logging functionalities with different levels and
custom
formatting. It can also be used as a library to simply format the various messages you print in the terminal.

## Installation

If you want to use this library for one of your projects, you can install it like any other Go library

```shell
cargo add tangra
```

## Customizing

### Prefix

The prefix, what comes before the message, can be changed with the `set_prefix` method on a `Logger` structure.

> The default prefix is `$[datetime] $[level:color]$[level:name]$[reset]: `

### Placeholders

There are formatting placeholders that will be replaced in both the message and the prefix that can be
seen [here](PLACEHOLDERS.md).

[For example](examples), logging the following message

```
$[fg:red]$[effect:blink]$[effect:bold]$[sys:username] says hello!
```

Will print a red blinking message in bold that says `<username> says hello!`, where `<username>` is the username on your
system.

### Styling

You can choose whether you want to style your messages or not with the `SetStyling` method on a `Logger` structure.
Styling includes foreground colors, background colors and special effects such as bold, and others - see
the [`terminal.rs`](src/terminal.rs) file.

> **Note**: The styling will **not** apply to the message if it is not supported by the terminal.

### Log File

Logs can also be written inside a log file with styling removed. [For example](examples/file.rs):

```rs
fn main() {
    let mut logger = tangra::Logger::new();
    logger.set_log_file_path("example.log");
    logger.debug("$[fg:red]$[effect:blink]$[effect:bold]$[sys:username] says hello!");
}
```
